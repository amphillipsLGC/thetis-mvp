## Serving Angular Static Files

The `UseBrowserStaticFiles` extension method configures the ASP\.NET Core app to serve static files generated by the Angular frontend. It sets up the middleware to serve files from the `wwwroot/browser` directory, ensuring that requests for frontend assets \(such as `index.html`, JavaScript, and CSS\) are handled correctly.

**How it works:**
- Serves static files and default files \(e\.g\. `index.html`\) from `wwwroot/browser`.
- Keeps `Program.cs` clean by encapsulating static file configuration in an extension method.

**Usage in `Program.cs`:**
```csharp
app.UseBrowserStaticFiles(builder.Environment.ContentRootPath);
```

This ensures your Angular app is properly served alongside your .NET backend.
